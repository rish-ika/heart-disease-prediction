# Heart Disease Prediction Project

##  Overview
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning.  
It analyzes medical data and predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease or not.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- HTML, CSS (for front-end templates)  
- Flask (for web framework)

##  Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes patient information such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Heart Rate  
- Blood Sugar  
- and other medical parameters.

## How It Works
1. Data is collected and cleaned.  
2. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms.  
3. A web interface is created using Flask where users can input data.  
4. The model predicts whether the person has heart disease.

##  How to Run
1. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.  
2. Run the `app.py` file to start the Flask server.  
3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the app.

## Future Improvements
- Add more medical features for higher accuracy.  
- Improve UI design.  
- Deploy the project online using platforms like Heroku or Render.
